###Use_Quandl
Quandl is a source for financial, economic, and alternative datasets. Quandl sources data from over 500 publishers and all Quandl's data are accessible via an API. The website address is “https://www.quandl.com/”. This is code I developed to collect financial data for a part of my research. I was only using their free datasets. You may use it as a template.
